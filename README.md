## About

[PyRoss](https://gitlab.com/rajeshrinet/pyross) is a numerical library for mathematical modelling of infectious disease in Python. The library supports structured compartment models formulated as systems of differential equations. Currently, these are the **SIR**, **SEIR**, **SEAIR**, and **SEAIRQ** models. 

The library was developed to model the outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 and to assess the age-structured impact of social distancing measures in India. 

The library is named after [Sir Ronald Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Ross), doctor, mathematician and poet. In 1898 he made "the great discovery" in his laboratory in Calcutta "that malaria is conveyed by the bite of a mosquito".  He won the Nobel Prize in 1902 and laid the foundations of the mathematical modelling of infectious diseases.
