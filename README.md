## About

[PyRoss](https://gitlab.com/rajeshrinet/pyross) is a numerical library for mathematical modelling of infectious disease in Python. The library supports structured compartment models formulated as systems of differential equations. Currently, these are the **SIR**, **SEIR**, **SEAIR**, and **SEAIRQ** models. 

The library was developed to model the outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 and to assess the age-structured impact of social distancing measures in India. 

The library is named after [Sir Ronald Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Ross), doctor, mathematician and poet. In 1898 he made "the great discovery" in his laboratory in Calcutta "that malaria is conveyed by the bite of a mosquito".  He won the Nobel Prize in 1902 and laid the foundations of the mathematical modelling of infectious diseases.

The list of COVID-19 cases is obtained from the [Worldometer website](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus).


## Examples
```Python
#Ex1: M=1, SIR
import numpy as np
import pyross
M = 1                  # the SIR model has no age structure
Ni = 1000*np.ones(M)   # so there is only one age group 
N = np.sum(Ni)         # and the total population is the size of this age group

beta  = 0.2            # infection rate 
gamma = 0.1            # recovery rate 
alpha = 0              # fraction of asymptomatic infectives 
fsa   = 1              # the self-isolation parameter 


Ia0 = np.array([0])     # the SIR model has only one kind of infective 
Is0 = np.array([1])     # we take these to be symptomatic 
R0  = np.array([0])     # and assume there are no recovered individuals initially 
S0  = N-(Ia0+Is0+R0)    # so that the initial susceptibles are obtained from S + Ia + Is + R = N

# there is no contact structure
def contactMatrix(t):   
    return np.identity(M) 

# duration of simulation and data file
Tf = 160;  Nt=160; filename = 'this.mat'

# instantiate model
parameters = {'alpha':alpha, 'beta':beta, 'gamma':gamma,'fsa':fsa}
model = pyross.models.SIR(parameters, M, Ni)

# simulate model
model.simulate(S0, Ia0, Is0, contactMatrix, Tf, Nt, filename)
```
